# Matcha
Tinder-like web application using Node.js, Express, MySQL and Handlebars as part of 42's web branch project. As per 42's rules, no ORM, external validators or User Accounts Manager were allowed.

Users can interact with each other and find their ultimate match depending on their geolocalisation and common interests.

This app has been deployed on Heroku only for your own fun - you probably won't find any real human ;)
